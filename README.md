# Repo for my Youtube clone
This is where my Youtube clone resides. It's the capstone project for the SuperSimpleDev HTML and CSS course. I learned quite a lot through that course, and I would like to give a special shoutout to Simon, for taking me through this course and enabling me achieve this.  
Here's a link to their channel, please check them out!
